    "I shall use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City and apply the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each of the neighborhoods. I will then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters and use the k-means clustering algorithm to refine the groupings. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters as well as push the right neighborhood for setting up the restaurant business.\n"
